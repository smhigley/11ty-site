## About

I 'm a web developer currently based in Seattle, WA. Professionally, I focus on creating accessible web apps using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I’m a contributor to the ARIA Authoring Practices and the Dojo framework, and an avid reader of WCAG updates. Outside work I enjoy photography, hiking, dancing, and listening to podcasts.
